This branch contains script(s) and info on how to retrieve a version from the
ZF(1) svn repositories.

Latest stable release (version) can be determined by accessing this url:
http://framework.zend.com/api/zf-version

Then one can do (in branch master):
rm *
svn export http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/tags/release-<version>/library/Zend/ .

Then you can run the strip.sh file, and tag it. Mag sure that the contents of library/Zend/ are
in the rootdir of the master branch, and that there's not just a single directory named Zend.

Naming convention for tags is: release-<version>
	meaning that when version = 1.11.6, the corresponding tag name would be release-1.11.6
